		<p> <strong><i>Abstract</i></strong> <br>
<i>
This document argues for a [/n/official content] naming convention &nbsp;&mdash;among the Democratic Leadership of the United States of America</i> <br><br><br>
  
now, in the year 2017, in terms of technology, specifically YouTube. &nbsp;(As freely available as widely used) And this naming convention is a method of which implemented by the party will result in cohesion, strength.  &nbsp;For by preserving naming conventions on official content to control, access, acknowledge, will push/further/press the image&nbsp;/&nbsp;mission of the party. <br><br>
In fact, below argues this &nbsp;'<strong>technology</strong>&nbsp; [generally]' and the control of:this &nbsp;"'<strong>technology</strong> [generally]'"&nbsp; is the destiny of liberal democracy, in the sense of realizing a moral and just system over which to do so. &nbsp;Entailing the use of a channel, freely accessible, and primary.  &nbsp;Suchas are important the official YouTube channels of US Senators and Representatives, Democratic Party*</p><br><br>

<p><strong><i>
Intro</i></strong><br>

 We will always be fighting for regularity in and against a system that knows disorder, works, disorder, &nbsp;  that is - always (moving) highly ordered systems unto low order or disorder.  &nbsp;Unlike that an organization, a thinking entity, ordering certain (inner) systems.  &nbsp;Here, as a larger system is brought to disorder, that is, brought into chaos, a system of energy transferring always down, always in the net direction &nbsp; (to)--> disorder &nbsp; - but among which pockets came into being and exist, chiefly life.

<p class="intro">

<strong>Sir, Senator Leahy</strong>,<br>
 I know you are the absolute right person to address this very-open letter to. <p> <br> 
<p>
As you know Vermont is a truly blessed place, and is perhaps the longest intact continuous democracy, being an independent democratic republic prior to the establishment of this nation.  &nbsp;You are our leader, you are the ranking member of the senate.  &nbsp;Many people, most people, do not know- how crucial you were during the previous 'Bush' decades, serving as pro-tempore; you, the democratic senator from Vermont, were third in line for the presidential succession. &nbsp;There may very soon come a time when you will serve that position again.</p> <br>
<p>
And this I pledge to you: &nbsp;I will work with all I can muster: contribute to, help move, which will inevitably see you again as not only, -now, - ranking member of the senate, but de facto enshrined with constitutional authority as pro-tempore leader.  &nbsp;So we must prepare.  &nbsp;<strong>Take back the house, win.  &nbsp;Take back the senate, champion.  &nbsp;Take back the executive and govern.  </strong>

</p> <br> <hr>

<p>
<strong><i> Findings:</i></strong></p>
<strong>
<ul>
<li> Delegating / delivering content distribution over official channels strengthens the party</li>
<li> We see the consistent diminution of our authority as sources</li>
<li> Producers and creators further their own image even 'monetize' the message, not wholly corrupt, but only in the interest of the party when which aligns to moral and ethical standards</li>
<li> It is important to preserve the record, distribute the record, and to know and own it. In those ordered parameters we have a powerful platform at our disposal.  &nbsp;And it is a means of control over our image, message, and destiny</li>
<li> Democratic Party becomes a digital construction: governed by a sophisticated and yet not realized moral philosophy</li>
</ul></strong>
<p><br></p>

<p>
<strong><i> Part 1</i></strong></p>
<p>Establish some uniformity in pattern for naming </p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User: Senator Patrick Leahy (for example)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not: Office of Senator Patrick Leahy <br>		
(this is the naming convention followed or established by Warren and Sanders)<br> 
Don't camel case like, e.g.,  JohnMills <br>
Less than ten minutes per video if possible <br>	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further norms can be established for the purpose of optimizing access, accessibility, integrity </p>

<p>Use some convention, Google would likely be happy to help in the special case where something like a username seemingly cannot be altered.

<strong><i> Discussion</i></strong></p>

<p> Friend we can all be Bernie Sanders and Warren's, we can all be stars.  &nbsp;I mean you tube channels with thousands of followers, hundreds of thousands of views, over their (chiefly by a factor of 10 Sanders' and Warren's) official channels over any other among the democratic leadership!  &nbsp;[ And as us senators have &lt;50 views per video I can only imagine local electors have no motivation, and may be embarrased to post a video of a critical action. ]  </p>
<br><br>
<p>
 I honestly have not and will not even consider looking up the other side to pairwise compare.  But I know <strong>delegating content distribution over official channels strengthens the party.</strong>  &nbsp;All our leaders have great great original content, with (per video)  ~&lt;5 -150 views over a span of months or even years.  &nbsp;These official YouTube channels have no uniformity among them such as User Name or 'title' of video uploads.  &nbsp;Yet, note the extreme quality, importance, of this work, what ([is unlike in access/'views'].  &nbsp;I have seen is) unified in content, tasteful, I soak it up and love it.
</p><br><br>
<p>
It is a simple discredit to let this resource go untapped and, also, to let others take (creating annoying content, waterdown to the extent that it is, secondary [evidentially], non-authoritative:  Honest commentary (potentially, even) but we are letting YouTube channels get away with what is ours. &nbsp;Often the ratio of content to commentary in a &lt;10 min video is ~ 50:50, tending more on the side of commentary: For it is in the best interest of these producers and creators to further their own image even ‘monetize’ the message, not wholly corrupt, but only in the interest of the party when which aligns to moral and ethical standards.  &nbsp;The most widely consumed content is the most mast produced, yet, unless we are careful whom we trust, we will see, as now, the consistent diminution of our authority as sources. &nbsp;\[primary, consistent, and powerful due to easy organization]: What is in the best will of the people will become.</p>
<br><br>

<p>

What is important is to preserve the record, distribute the record, and to know and own it. &nbsp;In those ordered parameters we have a powerful platform at our disposal. &nbsp;And it is a means of control over our image, message, and destiny.  &nbsp;Destiny, only a word, yet I believe liberal democracy has a tremendous and great future as it has: I believe in liberal democracy, and I know how blind I am.  &nbsp;I am blind to the reality.  &nbsp;I am optimistic about the future chiefly because I am not subject to wrongdoings in the past.  &nbsp;In my past, my life I can fight, work, for what I believe.  And rather than working against our enemies let us work for ourselves.  &nbsp;Let us build the future.  &nbsp;I see the Democratic Party becoming a digital construction.  &nbsp;One day the protests will end.  We will be at peace, and I believe it will be when truly, power rests in the hands of those we trust, when and where everything is open (governed by a sophisticated), and yet not (until) realized moral philosophy, lived, where exactly harm is only an abstract concept. &nbsp;And people there know only respect and kindness. It is a like cause and unity that brings us together: technology [and, it is a means of our humanity, the like of which we are desperate for, as in (now disparate) human rights, worker's rights, liberties and fraternity.  &nbsp;Only us, proprietors of liberal concepts, and only you, our leaders, can ultimately secure us.  &nbsp;For in a democracy we are empowered and&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;of free mind and conscious give you, representors, our bodily powers of will trusting in you like and kind.  &nbsp;So we must realize this, a system of true democracy, settling down onto its master: technology, of which we control: &nbsp;And which is truly the controller of the world, youtube, apple, other industry have built a technology which is powerful in hands by them and powerful in any hands, it could have been us who made this great technology and brought peace to do so, but now this is all our task, and as always and I believe it is but a snap to the inevitable that is our way. </p><br>

<br>

<p>


<strong><i> Conclusion</i></strong></p>
<p>
What I suggest is we capitalize on what we have, use what we have: Honesty, foresight, ethics/morality/justice.  The world is one thing and our beliefs are another.  I choose my heart mind, body, soul, and I believe liberal democracy is the future, in so much as it is wholly within our capacity to realize. And what seems costly now is not costly in the end.(, e.g,.) Take health-care where the standard end is a single payer efficient system.
